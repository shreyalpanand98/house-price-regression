# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a beginner-friendly implementation of linear regression
to predict house sale prices using the Kaggle House Prices dataset. The focus is on
understanding regression fundamentals, feature selection, and model evaluation.

## Objective
Build and evaluate a linear regression model to predict house prices and analyze
how adding numeric features improves model performance.

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle – House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques  
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

## Approach
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the target variable
- Built a baseline linear regression model using a single feature
- Improved the model by adding multiple numeric features
- Evaluated performance using RMSE and R²
- Visualized predicted vs actual prices

## Key Learnings
- Feature selection significantly impacts regression performance
- RMSE provides an intuitive measure of prediction error
- R² explains how much variance the model captures
- Linear regression serves as a strong, interpretable baseline

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Limitations
This project focuses on foundational regression concepts. Advanced preprocessing,
categorical encoding, and nonlinear models were intentionally excluded to maintain
clarity and interpretability.
